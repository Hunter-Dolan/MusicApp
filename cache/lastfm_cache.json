It was released as the third CD single from the album behind \"What's My Age Again?\" and \"All the Small Things\" on September 5, 2000. \"Adam's Song\" was one of five blink-182 songs that peaked at #2 on the US Modern Rock Tracks chart. Vocals on the song are performed by Mark Hoppus.\n\n\"Adam's Song\" is commonly referred to as the song when blink-182 got \"serious\", being their first well-known slow-paced baker. The song is placed in between the catchy and fast-paced songs \"Dysentery Gary\" and \"All the Small Things\".\n\nThe song's lyrics deal with depression and suicide, a noticeable departure from the toilet humor present in most of the other songs on Enema of the State. The arrangement of the song departs from their previous work as well, particularly the shifting instrumental parts. In the verses, the guitar plays (muted) chords accompanied by a relatively ordinary bass line; in the chorus the guitar plays octave lines while the bass shifts to playing chords. It is comparable to their later song \"Stay Together For The Kids\" (dealing with 'broken home' and family issues), from blink-182's fourth studio album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket.\n\nThe song makes a reference to \"Come as You Are\" by Nirvana with the lyrics, \"I took my time, I hurried up, The choice was mine, I didn't think enough.\" While Nirvana's lyrics are \"Take your time, hurry up, the choice is yours, don't be late.\"\n\nIt was once thought that the website Adam's Letter featured the inspiration behind the song, though this was later revealed as a fictitious story, and any \"resemblance between the characters, places, and events to any real people is purely coincidental.\"\n\nThe song caused a stir in 2000 when it was set to replay indefinitely on a nearby stereo as 17-year-old Greg Barnes, a survivor of the Columbine High School massacre, hanged himself in the garage of his family's home. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/blink-182/_/Adam%27s+Song\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The song was planned for release as a single in July 2009, but withheld because the band felt it was not complete. On July 12, 2011, the band announced the song would premiere on July 15.\n\nHistory\n\nAfter the reunion at the 2009 Grammy Awards, Blink-182 began production on a new studio album. As the band got back together, drummer Travis Barker said that the trio immediately \"got inspired\" by practicing their old songs and listening to them again, and they decided to record demos. There were four demos done, and only one was near completion, called \"Up All Night\". The song was originally titled \"The Night the Moon Was Gone\", a name DeLonge's daughter, Ava, came up with. Quickly they realized that it was too ambitious to complete it before their reunion tour began in July.\n\nWhen the band set off for tour, Tom DeLonge described the song as \"almost finished.\" The band raised concerns that the song would debut to some fans as a bootleg-recorded version on sites such as YouTube, and opted to not release it: \"It’s not so much that we were concerned that it was going to get played somewhere where we didn’t have control of it,\" said DeLonge. \"We were just concerned that the first impressions weren’t going to be the beautiful hard work that we put into recording the song and the way we recorded it.\n\nMusic\n\nBarker, in June 2009, called \"Up All Night\" a \"logical step-forward\" from the music found on the band's previous effort, blink-182 (2003). Barker also hinted that when the band was able to get back together and record, that that would be the direction they would take. He called the track \"heavy,\" and added that it sounded like \"if you mixed Box Car Racer and Blink.\" \"Up All Night\" contains elements of everything the band has done,and pushes further than they've gone before, according to Hoppus. <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/blink-182/_/Up+All+Night\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
